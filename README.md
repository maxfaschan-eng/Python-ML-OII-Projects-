This repository contains an excerpt of Python-powered projects I conducted during my tenure at the OII. It features the application of coding best practices, leading algorithms and models via application of prominent and foundational Python packages to arrives at intriguing anayltical insights acrosss a range of Social Science questions and hypthesses

Project "NLP" (Natural Language Processing): Lexical disambiguation of 800 research paper abstracts using LSTMs, Neural Networks & Logistic Regression

Project "DAS" (Data Analytics at Scale): Computational optimisation of image hashing algorithms

Project "AML" (Applied Machine Learning): Gradient-boosted trees (GBT)and programatic hyperparameter optimization for life outcome prediction among fragile families

Project "AAS" (Applied Analtcial Statistics):  Explorative anaylsis of price deter- minants of Airbnb property listings in the city of Berlin
